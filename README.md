# drew-i-kit
> A collection of highly composeable React components.

## Why?
After building several UIKits in React with Styled Components, I decided to build out my own little UIKit that I could start projects from. I'm calling it "drew-i-kit". Get it? ðŸ˜œ

## Dependencies
- `react`
- `prop-types`
- `normalize.css`
- `styled-components`
- `styled-tools`
- `lodash`

## Testing
- `yarn storybook` to load up Storybook and view the components
- `yarn test` to run all of the unit tests

## File Structure
Here is my (currently) preferred file structure for React apps (usually starts in a `src/` directory):

```
â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”œâ”€â”€ config
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”œâ”€â”€ styled
â”œâ”€â”€ routes
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
```

### Components
The primary application-level components in your application.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentName
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tests
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ComponentName.test.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ComponentName.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ComponentName.story.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
```

### Config
Configuration files: `theme.js`, `icons.js`, etc.

### Lib
Library files, such as utilities and helpers.

### Routes
Each route component.

### index.js
The entry point.
